        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Toss zucchinis and onions in a large bowl with olive oil until evenly coated. Spread vegetables into a large baking dish</li>
            <li>Roast vegetables in the preheated oven until golden, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Heat marinara sauce in a saucepan over medium heat until sauce is hot. Spread hot marinara sauce into the prepared baking dish, followed by penne pasta and zucchini mixture. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese atop vegetables.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow casserole to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
